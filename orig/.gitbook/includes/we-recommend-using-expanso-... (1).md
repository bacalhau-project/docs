{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend using [Expanso Cloud](https://getwaitlist.com/waitlist/23135) to create your network! But if you'd like to set up a cluster on your own, you can use our tool [Andaime](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/andaime) to do this too.&#x20;

If you have any questions about the platform - please contact us on [Slack](https://bit.ly/bacalhau-project-slack) or [Email](mailto:questions@expanso.io) us!
