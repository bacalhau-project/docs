# Setting Up a Cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) With Terraform ðŸš€

Welcome to the guide for setting up your own Bacalhau cluster across multiple Google Cloud Platform (GCP) regions! This guide will walk you through creating a robust, distributed compute cluster that's perfect for running your Bacalhau workloads.

### What You'll Build

Think of this as building your own distributed supercomputer! Your cluster will provision compute nodes spread across different GCP regions for global coverage.

### Before You Start

You'll need a few things ready:

* Terraform (version 1.0.0 or newer)
* A running Bacalhau orchestrator node
* Google Cloud SDK installed and set up
* An active GCP billing account
* Your organization ID handy
* An SSH key pair for securely accessing your nodes

### Quick Setup Guide

1. Make sure you are logged in with GCP. This could involve both of the following commands:

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```



1. Clone the examples repo to your machine and go into the GCP directory.&#x20;

```
gh repo clone bacalhau-project/examples
cd setting-up-bacalhau-cluster/setting-up-bacalhau-with-terraform-on-GC 
```

1.  Now, make a copy of the example environment file:

    ```bash
    cp env.json.example env.json
    ```
2. Open up `env.json` and fill in your GCP details (more on this below!)
3.  Update your `config/config.yaml` with your orchestrator information. Specifically, these lines:

    ```
      Orchestrators:
        - nats://EXAMPLE-7a02-4083-bf08-bcc2f5fbc025.us1.cloud.expanso.dev:4222
      Auth:
        Token: "EXAMPLE-aEEFukWVffnf5jb9QkpNnwfiBWEk3475csM7ysudpbFTzYBap5c7sWr6"
    ```

    1. L
4.  Let Terraform get everything ready:

    ```bash
    terraform init --env-file env.json
    ```
5.  Launch your cluster:

    ```bash
    terraform apply --env-file env.json
    ```

The entire process takes about 8 minutes, but should end with something like the below:

```hcl
Apply complete! Resources: 17 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

deployment_status = {
  "asia-northeast1" = {
    "external_ip" = "35.221.64.233"
    "health_check" = "healthy"
    "name" = "bacalhau-cluster-2501020854-asia-northeast1-vm"
  }
  
[...]

  "europe-west12" = {
    "external_ip" = "34.17.50.110"
    "internal_ip" = "10.210.0.2"
    "name" = "bacalhau-cluster-2501020854-europe-west12-vm"
    "zone" = "europe-west12-a"
  }
}
```

You're good to go!

### Customizing Your Network

The `env.json` file is where all the magic happens. Here's what you'll need to fill in:

#### Essential Settings

* `bootstrap_project_id`: Your existing GCP project (just used for setup)
* `base_project_name`: What you want to call your new project
* `gcp_billing_account_id`: Where the charges should go
* `gcp_user_email`: Your GCP email address
* `org_id`: Your organization's ID
* `app_tag`: A friendly name for your resources (like "bacalhau-demo")

#### Node Configuration

* `bacalhau_data_dir`: Where job data should be stored
* `bacalhau_node_dir`: Where node configs should live
* `username`: Your SSH username
* `public_key`: Path to your SSH public key

#### Location Settings

You can set up nodes in different regions with custom configurations:

```json
"locations": {
  "us-central1": {
    "zone": "us-central1-a",
    "node_count": 3,
    "machine_type": "e2-standard-4"
  }
}
```

### Taking Your Cluster for a Test Drive

Once everything's up and running, let's make sure it works!

First, make sure you have the Bacalhau CLI installed. You can read more about installing the CLI [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation).

1.  First configure the CLI to use your cluster:

    ```bash
    bacalhau config set -c API.Host=<orchestrator-ip>
    ```
2.  Check on the health of your nodes:

    ```bash
    bacalhau node list
    ```
3. If you're using the Expanso Cloud hosted orchestrator (Recommended!), you can look at your nodes on the [Expanso Cloud](https://cloud.expanso.io/networks/) dashboard in real-time.
4.  Run a simple test job:

    ```bash
    bacalhau docker run ubuntu echo "Hello from my cluster!" 
    ```
5.  Check on your jobs:

    ```bash
    bacalhau list
    ```
6.  Get your results:

    ```bash
    bacalhau get <job-id>
    ```

### Troubleshooting Tips

Having issues? Here are some common solutions:

#### Deployment Problems

* Double-check your GCP permissions
* Make sure your billing account is active
* Verify that all needed APIs are turned on in GCP

#### Node Health Issues

* Look at the logs on a node: `journalctl -u bacalhau-startup.service`
* Check Docker logs on a node: `docker logs <container-id>`
* Make sure that port 4222 isn't blocked

#### Job Running Troubles

* Verify your NATS connection settings
* Check if nodes are properly registered
* Make sure compute is enabled in your config

### Cleaning Up

When you're done, clean everything up with:

```bash
terraform destroy --env-file env.json
```

### Need to Check on Things?

If you need to peek under the hood, here's how:

1.  Find your node IPs:

    ```bash
    terraform output instance_ips
    ```
2.  SSH into a node:

    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@<public-ip>
    ```
3.  Check on Docker:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
4.  Go into the container on the node:

    ```bash
    CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps --filter name=^/bacalhau_node --format '{{.ID}}' | head -n1)
    docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
    ```

### Understanding the Configuration Files

Here's what each important file does in your setup:

#### Core Files

* `main.tf`: Your main Terraform configuration
* `variables.tf`: Where input variables are defined
* `outputs.tf`: What information Terraform will show you
* `config/config.yaml`: How your Bacalhau nodes are configured
* `scripts/startup.sh`: Gets your nodes ready to run
* `scripts/bacalhau-startup.service`: Manages the Bacalhau service

#### Cloud-Init and Docker Setup

* `cloud-init/init-vm.yml`: Sets up your VM environment, installs packages, and gets services running
* `config/docker-compose.yml`: Runs Bacalhau in a privileged container with all the right volumes and health checks

The neat thing is that most of your configuration happens in just one file: `env.json`. Though if you want to get fancy, there's lots more you can customize!
