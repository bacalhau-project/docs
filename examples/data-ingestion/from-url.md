# Copy Data from URL to Public Storage

To upload a file from a URL we will use the `bacalhau docker run` command.

```bash
bacalhau docker run \
    --id-only \
    --wait \
    --input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau/main/README.md \
    ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/upload:v1
```

The job has been submitted and Bacalhau has printed out the related job id.

#### Structure of the command[​](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/data-ingestion/from-url#structure-of-the-command) <a href="#structure-of-the-command" id="structure-of-the-command"></a>

Let's look closely at the command above:

1. `bacalhau docker run`: call to bacalhau using docker executor
2. `--input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau/main/README.md`: URL path of the input data volumes downloaded from a URL source.
3. `ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/upload:v1`: the name and tag of the docker image we are using

The `bacalhau docker run` command takes advantage of the `--input` parameter. This will download a file from a public URL and place it in the `/inputs` directory of the container (by default). Then we will use a helper container to move that data to the /outputs directory.

You can find out more about the [helper container in the examples repository](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/examples/tree/main/tools/upload) which is designed to simplify the data uploading process.

### Checking the State of Your Jobs[​](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/data-ingestion/from-url#checking-the-state-of-your-jobs) <a href="#checking-the-state-of-your-jobs" id="checking-the-state-of-your-jobs"></a>

**Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau job list`, processing the json ouput with the `jq`:

```bash
bacalhau job list $JOB_ID --output=json | jq '.[0].Status.JobState.Nodes[] | .Shards."0" | select(.RunOutput)'
```

When the job status is `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results using the job ID.

**Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau job describe`.

```bash
bacalhau job describe  $JOB_ID 
```

**Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau job get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we removed a directory in case it was present before, created it and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.

```bash
rm -rf results && mkdir ./results
bacalhau job get --output-dir ./results $JOB_ID 
```

### Viewing your Job Output[​](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/data-ingestion/from-url#viewing-your-job-output) <a href="#viewing-your-job-output" id="viewing-your-job-output"></a>

Each job result contains an `outputs` subfolder and `exitCode`, `stderr` and `stdout` files with relevant content. To view the execution logs execute following:

```bash
head -n 15 ./results/stdout
```

And to view the job execution result (`README.md` file in the example case), which was saved as a job output, execute:

```bash
tail ./results/outputs/README.md
```

### Get the CID From the Completed Job[​](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/data-ingestion/from-url#get-the-cid-from-the-completed-job) <a href="#get-the-cid-from-the-completed-job" id="get-the-cid-from-the-completed-job"></a>

To get the output CID from a completed job, run the following command:

```bash
bacalhau job list $JOB_ID --output=json | jq -r '.[0].Status.JobState.Nodes[] | .Shards."0".PublishedResults | select(.CID) | .CID'
```

The job will upload the CID to the public storage via IPFS. We will store the CID in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.

### Use the CID in a New Bacalhau Job[​](http://localhost:3000/setting-up/data-ingestion/from-url#use-the-cid-in-a-new-bacalhau-job) <a href="#use-the-cid-in-a-new-bacalhau-job" id="use-the-cid-in-a-new-bacalhau-job"></a>

Now that we have the CID, we can use it in a new job. This time we will use the `--input` parameter to tell Bacalhau to use the CID we just uploaded.

In this case, the only goal of our job is just to list the contents of the `/inputs` directory. You can see that the "input" data is located under `/inputs/outputs/README.md`.

```bash
bacalhau docker run \
    --id-only \
    --wait \
    --input ipfs://$CID \
    ubuntu -- \
    bash -c "set -x; ls -l /inputs; ls -l /inputs/outputs; cat /inputs/outputs/README.md"
```

The job has been submitted and Bacalhau has printed out the related job id. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.
