# Downloading Results

After a Bacalhau job completes, you'll need to retrieve the output files generated by your job. This guide explains the basics of downloading job results.

### What You'll Learn

* How to specify output paths in your jobs
* How to retrieve job results using the CLI

### Getting Job Results

To download the results of a completed job:

```bash
bacalhau job get <jobID>
```

This command downloads all outputs from the job to your current directory.

#### Specifying an Output Directory

You can specify where to save the downloaded results:

```bash
bacalhau job get <jobID> --output-dir /path/to/save
```

#### Download Timeout Setting

For larger downloads, you can adjust the timeout:

```bash
bacalhau job get <jobID> --download-timeout-secs 10m
```

### Specifying Job Outputs and Publisher

When submitting a job, you need to define which files or directories should be collected as outputs, and where those outputs should be published.

#### Using Command Line

For Docker jobs, use the `--output` flag to define outputs and the `--publisher` flag to specify where to publish the results:

```bash
bacalhau docker run \
  --output results:/outputs \
  --publisher s3://my-bucket/results-folder \
  ubuntu:latest \
  -- echo "Hello, World!" > /outputs/hello.txt
```

This tells Bacalhau to:

1. Collect everything in the `/outputs` directory of the container
2. Publish it to the specified S3 bucket and path
3. Make it available for download with `bacalhau job get`

#### Using Declarative Submission

You can also define outputs in a job specification file:

```yaml
Type: batch
Count: 1
Tasks:
  - Name: main
    Engine:
      Type: docker
      Params:
        Image: python:3.9
        Entrypoint:
          - "python"
          - "-c"
          - "import os; os.makedirs('/outputs', exist_ok=True); open('/outputs/result.txt', 'w').write('Analysis complete!')"
    Publisher:
      Type: s3
      Params:
        Bucket: my-bucket
        Key: results-folder
    ResultPaths:
      - Name: results
        Path: /outputs
```

Submit this job using:

```bash
bacalhau job run job-spec.yaml
```

#### Multiple Output Paths

You can specify multiple output paths in a single job:

```bash
bacalhau docker run \
  --output logs:/var/log \
  --output results:/outputs \
  --publisher s3://my-bucket/results-folder \
  ubuntu:latest \
  -- <your-command>
```

### Downloaded Results Structure

After running `bacalhau job get`, the results will be organized in a directory structure like this:

```
.
├── job-j-6bafb8d4
│   ├── exitCode
│   ├── outputs
│   │   └── file1
│   ├── stderr
│   └── stdout
```

The directory structure includes:

* `exitCode`: Contains the exit code of the job
* `outputs`: Contains all the files from the job's specified output directories
* `stderr`: Captures any error output from the job
* `stdout`: Captures the standard output from the job
