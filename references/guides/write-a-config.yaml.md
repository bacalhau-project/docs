# Write a config.yaml

On installation, Bacalhau creates a `.bacalhau` directory that includes a `config.yaml` file tailored for your specific settings. This configuration file is the central repository for custom settings for your Bacalhau nodes.

When initializing a Bacalhau node, the system determines its configuration by following a specific hierarchy. First, it checks the default settings, then the `config.yaml` file, followed by environment variables, and finally, any command line flags specified during execution. Configurations are set and overridden in that sequence. This layered approach allows the default Bacalhau settings to provide a baseline, while environment variables and command-line flags offer added flexibility. However, the `config.yaml` file offers a reliable way to predefine all necessary settings before node creation across environments, ensuring consistency and ease of management.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Modifications to the `config.yaml` file are not dynamically applied to existing nodes. A restart of the Bacalhau node is required for any changes to take effect.
{% endhint %}

Your `config.yaml` file starts off empty. However, you can see all available settings using the following command

```bash
bacalhau config list
```

This command showcases over a hundred configuration parameters related to users, security, metrics, updates, and node configuration, providing a comprehensive overview of the customization options available for your Bacalhau setup.

Letâ€™s go through the different options and how your configuration file is structured.

### Config.yaml Structure

The `bacalhau config list` command displays your configuration paths, segmented with periods to indicate each part you are configuring.

Consider these configuration settings: `NameProvider` and `Labels`. These settings help set name and labels for your Bacalhau node.

In your `config.yaml`, these settings will be formatted like this:

```yaml
labels:
    NodeType: WebServer
    OS: Linux
nameprovider: puuid
```

### Configuration Options

Here are your Bacalhau configuration options in alphabetical order:

| Configuration Option                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| API.Auth.AccessPolicyPath                        | AccessPolicyPath is the path to a file or directory that will be loaded as the policy to apply to all inbound API requests. If unspecified, a policy that permits access to all API endpoints to both authenticated and unauthenticated users (the default as of v1.2.0) will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| API.Auth.Methods                                 | Methods maps "method names" to authenticator implementations. A method name is a human-readable string chosen by the person configuring the system that is shown to users to help them pick the authentication method they want to use. There can be multiple usages of the same Authenticator _type_ but with different configs and parameters, each identified with a unique method name. For example, if an implementation wants to allow users to log in with Github or Bitbucket, they might both use an authenticator implementation of type "oidc", and each would appear once on this provider with key / method name "github" and "bitbucket". By default, only a single authentication method that accepts authentication via client keys will be enabled. |
