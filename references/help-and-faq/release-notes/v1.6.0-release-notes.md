# v1.6.0 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of Bacalhau v1.6.0, introducing a new communication architecture that significantly improves the reliability and resilience of distributed compute networks.

### Key Features and Improvements

#### New Bacalhau Messaging Protocol (BMP)

At the heart of this release is the new messaging protocol, a complete redesign of node communication that brings significant improvements to network reliability:

**Key Benefits**

* **Self-Healing Network:** Compute nodes and orchestrators automatically reconnect and sync after network interruptions
* **Offline-First Operation:** Compute nodes can start and operate even when disconnected from the orchestrator
* **Automatic State Recovery:** When nodes reconnect, they automatically share all missed job execution information and results
* **Zero Data Loss:** Ensures no job execution data or results are lost during network disruptions
* **Seamless Recovery:** Network interruptions are handled transparently without requiring manual intervention

**Technical Improvements**

* **Reliable Message Delivery:** Ordered, at-least-once message delivery between nodes
* **Automatic Recovery:** Built-in failure detection and recovery mechanisms
* **Connection Health Monitoring:** Proactive health checks and connection management
* **Event-Based Architecture:** Decoupled event processing from message delivery
* **Efficient Checkpointing:** Maintains system state for reliable recovery
* **Backward Compatibility:** Maintains compatibility with v1.5 orchestrators

#### Enhanced Web UI Experience

* **Direct Result Downloads:** Download job results directly from the interface
* **Simplified Configuration:** Automatic request routing eliminates manual IP configuration
* **Improved Architecture:** Streamlined backend setup while maintaining security

#### Operational Improvements

* **Reverse Proxy Support:** Added capability to run orchestrator behind a reverse proxy
* **Agent Configuration:** New `bacalhau agent config` command to inspect agent configuration
* **TLS Support:** Added TLS encryption support for NATS communication
* **Better Logging:** Implemented more human-readable logging patterns

### Upgrade Notes and Backward Compatibility

Bacalhau v1.6.0 maintains backward compatibility while introducing the new BMP:

* Compute nodes maintain compatibility with v1.5 orchestrators, and vice versa
* Support for re-handshake from legacy clients

We're excited for you to experience the enhanced reliability and resilience provided by the BMP in Bacalhau v1.6.0. This release represents a significant architectural advancement in making distributed computing more robust and dependable.
