# v1.5.0 Release Notes

## Release Highlights

1. Major configuration management update
2. Major WebUI update: improved job and nodes monitoring and management
3. Improved error reporting
4. Improved job progress visibility
5. Cross-version compatibility: full support for `v1.4.0`

## Major Configuration Update

The approach to the Bacalhau configuration management has been significantly redesigned. The changes are described in more details [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/6P82bTsk0U7YoGty7i8i/guides/configuration-management). Another notable change is that the default endpoint is deprecated. So now in order to connect to the public demo network, the address `bootstrap.production.bacalhau.org` will need to be manually set in the `api.host` key:

```bash
bacalhau config set api.host bootstrap.production.bacalhau.org
```

or via `--config` flag when executing a command:

```bash
bacalhau docker run \
--config api.host=bootstrap.production.bacalhau.org \
alpine ls
```

## Major WebUI Update

The integrated web interface has been completely revamped to offer a more intuitive user experience:

1. Added dark interface theme
2. Added detailed view for jobs with real time log streaming mode
3. Added ability to stop a job via WebUI
4. Added detailed view for nodes

## Improved Error Reporting

The error return logic has been redesigned in the new version:

1. Certain error messages have been redesigned and shortened
2. The color of the error text has been changed to a more prominent - red
3. Correct HTTP status codes now are used. For example, when requesting a non-existent job, the response is returned with the code `404` instead of `500`, as in `v1.4.0` and earlier

## Improved Job Progress Visibility

The dynamic output of job status to the console has been redesigned:

1. More informative format, indicating important job execution details that were previously not displayed
2. Improved progress visibility for jobs with multiple executions
3. Added `--follow` flag which allows tracking job logs right after job start

## Cross-Version Compatibility

`v.1.5.0` is fully compatible with `v1.4.0` between any node types: Compute - Orchestrator and Client - Orchestrator, which provides seamless upgrade experience.
