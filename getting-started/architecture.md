# How Bacalhau Works

In this tutorial we will go over the components and the architecture of Bacalhau. You will learn how it is built, what components are used, how you could interact and how you could use Bacalhau.

## Chapter 1 - Architecture

Bacalhau is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that enables decentralized communication between computers. The network consists of two types of nodes, which can communicate with each other.

![Bacalhau Architecture](../.gitbook/assets/architecture-overview.webp)

The requester and compute nodes together form a p2p network and use gossiping to discover each other, share information about node capabilities, available resources and health status. Bacalhau is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that enables decentralized communication between computers.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Requester Node:** responsible for handling user requests, discovering and ranking compute nodes, forwarding jobs to compute nodes, and monitoring the job lifecycle.

**Compute Node:** responsible for executing jobs and producing results. Different compute nodes can be used for different types of jobs, depending on their capabilities and resources.
{% endhint %}

To interact with the Bacalhau network, users can use the Bacalhau CLI (command-line interface) to send requests to a requester node in the network. These requests are sent using the JSON format over HTTP, a widely-used protocol for transmitting data over the internet. Bacalhau's architecture involves two main sections which are the **core components** and **interfaces**.

### Core Components

The core components are responsible for handling requests and connecting different nodes. The network includes two different components:

<details>

<summary>Requester node</summary>

In the Bacalhau network, the requester node is responsible for handling requests from clients using `JSON` over `HTTP`. This node serves as the main custodian of jobs that are submitted to it. When a job is submitted to a requester node, it selects compute nodes that are capable and suitable to execute the job, and coordinates the job execution.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Compute node</summary>

In the Bacalhau network, it is the compute node that is responsible for determining whether it can execute a job or not. This model allows for a more decentralized approach to job orchestration as the network will function properly even if the requester nodes have stale view of the network, or if concurrent requesters are allocating jobs to the same compute nodes. Once the compute node has run the job and produced results, it will publish the results to a remote destination as specified in the job specification (e.g. `S3`), and notify the requester of the job completion. The compute node has a collection of named executors, storage sources, and publishers, and it will choose the most appropriate ones based on the job specifications.

</details>

### Interfaces

The interfaces handle the distribution, execution, storage and publishing of jobs. In the following all the different components are described and their respective protocols are shown.

<details>

<summary>Transport</summary>

The transport interface is responsible for sending messages about jobs that are created, accepted, and executed to other compute nodes. It also manages the identity of individual Bacalhau nodes to ensure that messages are only delivered to authorized nodes, which improves network security. To achieve this, the transport interface uses a protocol, which is a point-to-point scheduling protocol that runs securely and is used to distribute job messages efficiently to other nodes on the network. This is our upgrade to previous handlers as it ensures that messages are delivered to the right nodes without causing network congestion, thereby making communication between nodes more scalable and efficient.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Executor</summary>

The executor is a critical component of the Bacalhau network that handles the execution of jobs and ensures that the storage used by the job is local. One of its main responsibilities is to present the input and output storage volumes into the job when it is run. The executor performs two primary functions: presenting the storage volumes in a format that is suitable for the executor and running the job. When the job is completed, the executor will merge the `stdout`, `stderr` and named output volumes into a results folder that is then published to a remote location. Overall, the executor plays a crucial role in the Bacalhau network by ensuring that jobs are executed properly, and their results are published accurately.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Storage Provider</summary>

In a peer-to-peer network like Bacalhau, storage providers play a crucial role in presenting an upstream storage source. There can be different storage providers available in the network, each with its own way of manifesting the `CID (Content IDentifier)` to the executor. For instance, there can be a `POSIX` storage provider that presents the `CID` as a `POSIX` filesystem, or a library storage provider that streams the contents of the `CID` via a library call. Therefore, the storage providers and Executor implementations are loosely coupled, allowing the `POSIX` and library storage providers to be used across multiple executors, wherever it is deemed appropriate.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Publisher</summary>

The publisher is responsible for uploading the final results of a job to a remote location where clients can access them, such as S3 or IPFS.

</details>

## Chapter 2 - Job cycle

### Job preparation

You can create jobs in the Bacalhau network using various [job types](../references/jobs/job/job-types.md) introduced in version 1.2. Each job may need specific variables, resource requirements and data details that are described in the [Job Specification](../references/jobs/job/).

<details>

<summary>Advanced job preparation</summary>

Prepare data with Bacalhau by [copying from URLs](../examples/data-ingestion/from-url.md), [pinning to public storage](../examples/data-ingestion/pin.md) or [copying from an S3 bucket](../examples/data-ingestion/s3.md). Mount data anywhere for Bacalhau to run against. Refer to [IPFS](../references/jobs/job/task/sources/ipfs.md), [Local](../references/jobs/job/task/publishers/local.md), [S3](../references/jobs/job/task/publishers/s3.md) and [URL](../references/jobs/job/task/sources/url.md) Source Specifications for data source usage.

Optimize workflows without completely redesigning them. Run arbitrary tasks using Docker containers and WebAssembly images. Follow the Onboarding guides for [Docker](workload-onboarding/docker-workload-onboarding.md) and [WebAssembly](workload-onboarding/wasm-workload-onboarding.md) workloads.

Explore GPU workload support with Bacalhau. Learn how to run [GPU workloads](../setting-up/gpu.md) using the Bacalhau client in the GPU Workloads section. Integrate Python applications with Bacalhau using the [Bacalhau Python SDK](../integrations/python-sdk.md).

For node operation, refer to the [Running a Node](../setting-up/running-node/) section for configuring and running a Bacalhau node. If you prefer an isolated environment, explore the [Private Cluster](create-private-network/) for performing tasks without connecting to the main Bacalhau network.

</details>

### Job Submission

You should use the Bacalhau client to send a task to the network. The client transmits the job information to the Bacalhau network via established protocols and interfaces. Jobs submitted via the Bacalhau CLI are forwarded to a Bacalhau network node at (http://bootstrap.production.bacalhau.org/) via port `1234` by default. This Bacalhau node will act as the requester node for the duration of the job lifecycle.

Bacalhau provides an interface to interact with the server via a REST API. Bacalhau uses 127.0.0.1 as the localhost and 1234 as the port by default.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CLI" %}
```sh
bacalhau job run [flags]
```

You can use the command with [appropriate flags](../references/cli-reference/all-flags.md) to create a job in Bacalhau using JSON and YAML formats.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="API" %}
```
Endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/orchestrator/jobs` 
```

You can use [Create Job API Documentation](../references/api/jobs.md) to submit a new job for execution.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You can use the `bacalhau docker run` [command](../references/cli-reference/all-flags.md#docker-run) to start a job in a Docker container. Below, you can see an excerpt of the commands:

### Job Acceptance

When a job is submitted to a requester node, it selects compute nodes that are capable and suitable to execute the job, and communicate with them directly. The compute node has a collection of named executors, storage sources, and publishers, and it will choose the most appropriate ones based on the job specifications.

### Job execution

The selected compute node receives the job and starts its execution inside a container. The container can use different executors to work with the data and perform the necessary actions. A job can use the docker executor, WASM executor or a library storage volumes. Use [Docker Engine Specification](../references/jobs/job/task/engines/docker.md) to view the parameters to configure the Docker Engine. If you want tasks to be executed in a WebAssembly environment, pay attention to [WebAssembly Engine Specification](../references/jobs/job/task/engines/wasm.md).

### Results publishing

When the Compute node completes the job, it publishes the results to **S3's remote storage**, **IPFS**.

Bacalhau's seamless integration with IPFS ensures that users have a decentralized option for publishing their task results, enhancing accessibility and resilience while reducing dependence on a single point of failure. View [IPFS Publisher Specification](../references/jobs/job/task/publishers/ipfs.md) to get the detailed information.

Bacalhau's S3 Publisher provides users with a secure and efficient method to publish task results to any S3-compatible storage service. This publisher supports not just AWS S3, but other S3-compatible services offered by cloud providers like Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage, as well as open-source options like MinIO. View [S3 Publisher Specification](../references/jobs/job/task/publishers/s3.md) to get the detailed information.

## Chapter 3 - Returning Information

The Bacalhau client receives updates on the task execution status and results. A user can access the results and manage tasks through the command line interface.
