# Getting Started

### How to Use Bacalhau

Getting started with Bacalhau is super straight forward! Below we lay out the steps involved:

1. [Install the Bacalhau Command Line Interface (CLI)](step-1-install-the-bacalhau-cli.md)
2. [Run a job on the public demo Bacalhau network](step-2-running-your-own-job.md)
3. Get information about your Bacalhau job

That's it!

For more advanced users, you can create your own Bacalhau network, which [we walk through here](../create-private-network.md).

### Support

If you have questions or need support or guidance, please reach out to the [Bacalhau team via Slack](https://bacalhauproject.slack.com/ssb/redirect) (**#general** channel).
