# Installation

This section explains how to install Bacalhau on your machine, verify it's working, and understand basic requirements. Bacalhau is distributed as a single self-contained binary that can function as a client, orchestrator node, and compute nodeâ€”greatly simplifying deployment and management of your distributed compute network.

## Install the Bacalhau Binary

To install the CLI, choose your environment, and run the command(s) below.

<Tabs groupId="installation-methods">
<TabItem value="Linux/macOS (CLI)" label="Linux/macOS (CLI)">
```bash
curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash
```

- This fetches the latest Bacalhau release and places it in `/usr/local/bin` or a similar path.
- You many need sudo mode or root access to install the binary at the desired path
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows (CLI)" label="Windows (CLI)">
  Windows users can download the [latest release tarball from
  Github](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/releases) and extract `bacalhau.exe` to any location available in
  the PATH environment variable.

### Base Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/bacalhau:latest
```

- Suitable for running orchestrators, clients or compute nodes with no Docker support

### Docker in Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/bacalhau:latest-dind
```

- Suitable for running compute nodes that can run Docker based jobs
- Require `--privileged` mode when running the container
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify the Installation

```bash
bacalhau version
```

This should print:

- The local binary version
- The version of the orchestrator this client is connected to, if any
- The latest available version of bacalhau in case you are running an outdated version.

If you get `command not found`, verify your PATH includes the Bacalhau binary.

### Upgrading Bacalhau

To upgrade Bacalhau to the latest version, run the installation script. If Bacalhau is already installed, this will update it to the most recent version available.

## Requirements & Tips

- **Docker**:
  - Must be installed and running on any **compute** node to handle Docker-based jobs.
- **AWS Credentials** (if you're using S3):
  - For S3 inputs or outputs, the node needs valid AWS credentials (e.g., environment variables).
- **Running an Orchestrator & Compute**:
  - See [Quick Start](./quick-start.mdx) for how to run a local or hybrid node with `bacalhau serve --orchestrator --compute`.
- **`bacalhau devstack`**:
  - Perfect for local development or running tests.

## Next Steps

- Head over to Basic CLI Usage to learn how to submit, describe, and stop jobs.
- Check Common Workflows for steps on mounting data (S3, local folders) and publishing outputs.
- Explore References for advanced node management (Docker Compose, devstack, multi-node clusters).
