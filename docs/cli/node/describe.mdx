## Description

Using the `describe` sub-command under the `bacalhau node` umbrella, users can get comprehensive details of a node by providing its ID. This information is crucial for system administrators and network managers to understand the state, specifications, and other attributes of nodes in their infrastructure.

bacalhau node describe [id] [flags]
```

  - Displays the help documentation for the `describe` command.
- `--output format`:
  - Defines the desired format for the command's output.
  - Options: `"json"` or `"yaml"`
  - Default: `"yaml"`
- `--pretty`:
  - When this flag is used, the command will pretty print the output. This is applicable only for outputs in `json` and `yaml` formats.
