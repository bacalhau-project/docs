# Reject

The `bacalhau node reject` command offers administrators the ability to reject a compute node's request to join the cluster.

## Description

Using the `reject` sub-command, administrators can reject a node in the pending state from joining the cluster and receiving work. This feature is crucial for system administrators to manage the cluster and will stop the node from taking part in the cluster until approved.

## Usage

```bash
bacalhau node rejected [id] [flags]
```

## Flags

- `[id]`:
  - The unique identifier of the node you wish to describe.
- `-h`, `--help`:
  - Displays the help documentation for the `describe` command.
- `-m message`:
  - A message to be attached to the rejection action.

## Examples

1.  Reject a Node with ID `nodeID123`:

    ```bash
    bacalhau node reject nodeID123
    ```

2.  Reject a Node with an audit message:

    ```bash
    bacalhau node reject nodeID123 -m "potentially bad"
    ```
