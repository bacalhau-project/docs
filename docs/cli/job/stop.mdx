## Examples

1.  **Stop a Specific Job**:

    If you wish to halt the execution of a job, you can utilize the `stop` command. Here's how you can achieve that:

    **Command:**

    ```bash
    bacalhau job stop j-10eb97de-14cd-4db4-96ec-561bb943309a
    ```

    **Expected Output:**

    ```plaintext
    Checking job status

    	Connecting to network  ................  done ✅  0.0s
    	  Verifying job state  ................  done ✅  0.2s
    	          Stopping job ................  done ✅  0.1s

    Job stop successfully submitted with evaluation ID: 397fd425-8b1a-491e-952a-0632492e7ece
    ```

2.  **Silently Stop a Job**:

    If you prefer to terminate a job without seeing any verbose feedback or messages, the `--quiet` option can be used.

    **Command:**

    ```bash
    bacalhau job stop j-63b5ec0c-b5bf-4398-a152-b46c07abe52a --quiet
    ```

    **Expected Output:**

    ```plaintext
    [No output displayed as the operation is run quietly.]
    ```
