# Distributed Data Warehousing

### Overview

Traditional centralized data warehouses often struggle with high data transfer costs, increased latency, and compliance challenges. By adopting a distributed data warehousing approach, organizations can process and analyze data closer to its source, ensuring better performance, regulatory adherence, and cost efficiency.

### Challenges in Centralized Data Warehousing

* **High Data Transfer Costs** – Moving large datasets to a central location incurs significant storage and networking expenses.
* **Latency Issues** – Centralized processing introduces delays, making real-time insights difficult.
* **Scalability Constraints** – As data volumes grow, expanding a monolithic warehouse becomes increasingly complex and costly.
* **Compliance and Data Sovereignty** – Regulations like GDPR and HIPAA often require data to remain within specific regions, making centralized storage and processing non-compliant.

### Bacalhau’s Approach to Distributed Data Warehousing

Bacalhau simplifies distributed data warehousing by enabling compute to run near the data, reducing unnecessary transfers, ensuring compliance, and improving query performance. Compute nodes can be deployed across different regions and data centers, ensuring each location processes its own data efficiently. This approach allows for:

* **Reduced Data Movement** – Queries run locally, eliminating the need to transfer large datasets across networks.
* **Improved Query Performance** – Compute happens closer to the data, leading to lower latency and faster insights.
* **Seamless Scalability** – New compute nodes can be added dynamically as data volumes grow.
* **Compliance with Data Regulations** – Keeping data within its originating region helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements while maintaining full control over their datasets.

### Scatter and Gather Queries

Bacalhau enables efficient **scatter and gather** queries, a key technique in distributed data warehousing:

1. **Scatter Phase** – A query is sent to multiple nodes located near different datasets.
2. **Local Processing** – Each node processes the query on its local data, significantly reducing data size before transmission.
3. **Gather Phase** – The processed results from all nodes are collected and aggregated into the final output.

This approach optimizes performance, ensures compliance by keeping data in its designated region, and reduces network overhead.

### Integration with Modern Data Tools

Bacalhau integrates seamlessly with modern data tools like **Apache Iceberg** and **DuckDB**, enhancing its distributed processing capabilities:

* **Apache Iceberg** – A high-performance table format for large analytic datasets, enabling schema evolution, partitioning, and efficient data access across distributed environments.
* **DuckDB** – An in-process analytical database optimized for executing complex queries efficiently. DuckDB’s compatibility with Iceberg tables allows for fast, distributed query execution while keeping data in place.

Together, these tools provide a powerful foundation for decentralized data warehousing while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Next Steps

To implement a distributed data warehouse using Bacalhau:

1. **Deploy Compute Nodes** – Set up nodes in locations where your data is generated or stored to ensure compliance with data residency requirements.
2. **Configure Data Storage** – Use Iceberg for managing structured datasets efficiently while maintaining data governance policies.
3. **Execute Distributed Queries** – Utilize DuckDB to process analytics directly on distributed data sources, keeping data within compliance boundaries.

By leveraging distributed data warehousing with Bacalhau, organizations can achieve real-time insights while optimizing costs, scalability, and regulatory compliance.
