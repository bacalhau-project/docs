# Lilypad

### **Overview**

Lilypad provides a decentralized compute infrastructure, leveraging Bacalhau to distribute and execute compute jobs efficiently. It is designed for use cases such as AI inference, machine learning training, decentralized science (DeSci), and more. Lilypad collaborates with decentralized storage and compute networks to enable transparent and scalable computational resources.

#### **Key Features**

* **Decentralized Compute** – Enables trustless, verifiable execution of workloads across thousands of nodes.
* **Multi-Chain Support** – Expanding support for various blockchain ecosystems.
* **Partitioned & Distributed Processing** – Uses Bacalhau’s orchestration to split workloads efficiently.
* **AI & Web3 Applications** – Supports AI, ML, and other high-performance workloads without requiring centralized infrastructure.
